# JS - I Love Pizza

Exercise proposed by Factor√≠a F5 Bootcamp to get started and practice JS. 

## What did the exercise consist of?

The exercise started in small groups of 4 people with the objective of printing the recipe for several pizzas on the terminal and being able to choose one of them. Having completed the first two levels with my classmates, the third level was done individually. 

With the recipes already organized in the js file, the next objective was to create an interface in the DOM so that the user can visualize the available pizzas, their ingredients and the cooking procedure. In addition to give style to this page, simulating that we were a real restaurant and the customer would like to see our selection of products through the web.
